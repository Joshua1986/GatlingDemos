GatlingDemos
=============

This project includes gatling load test scripts and a simple server which is tested.
I will constantly add the gatling scripts.

FlaskProject is an independent project which provides different types of interfaces. Run myapplication.py to start up.
Repalce the user-files folder into gatling's user-files folder, run /bin/gatling.sh to start up. You need to install gatling first.
